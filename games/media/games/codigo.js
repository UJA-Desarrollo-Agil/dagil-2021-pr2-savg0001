        "<p>Between each chunk of new text, Undum inserts a discreet line\
        in the margin. This allows you to see at a glance everything that\
        has been output as a result of your last click.\
        It is particularly useful for small devices, or when\
        lots of content has appeared. The window also scrolls so the start\
        of the new content is as near to the top of the window as possible.\
        This is also designed to help you read more naturally.</p>\
        \
        <p>If you've been watching carefully, you will have noticed that\
        parts of the text have been disappearing when you move between\
        situations. This isn't a bug! One of the aims of Undum is to give\
        game designers the ability to make the transcript of\
        the game read as a coherent piece of narrative. However, you often\
        need chunks of text that do nothing but offer the reader choices.\
        Undum defines a special CSS class to add to your HTML for this\
        (remember generated content is just HTML). It is <em>transient</em>,\
        and can be applied to paragraphs, <em>div</em>s, or just\
        <em>span</em>s<span class='transient'> (such as this one)</span>.</p>\
        \
        <p>You may also have noticed that, when you move situations, all the\
        links in the previous situation turn into regular text. This is to\
        stop you backtracking and trying previous options when you've already\
        committed to one. In other H-IF systems, this is\
        done by completely removing the content from previous pages.\
        That prevents you going back and reading your story, however.</p>\
        \
        <p class='transient'>The 'Different Kinds of Links' topic has more\
        about these links.\
        Let's return to the <a href='hub'>topic list</a>.</p>",

        "<p>There are three types of link in Undum. The first two we've seen\
        in previous topics:\
        links to change situation and links to carry out an action. When you\
        include a link in your output, Undum parses it and wires it up\
        correctly. If you create a link with a HTML <em>href</em> attribute\
        containing just a name ('ballroom', for\
        example) this will send the character to the situation with that\
        name. Links\
        with two components ('ballroom/view-painting', for example) send\
        the character to a new situation <em>and then</em> carry out the\
        named action ('view-painting' in this case). To carry out an action\
        in the current situation, you can replace the situation name with a\
        dot (so it would be './view-painting'). In all cases, if the\
        character is already in that situation, then the situation's\
        <em>enter</em> method won't be called again.</p>\
        \
        <img src='media/games/tutorial/woodcut2.png' class='float_left'>\
        <p>The third type of link, then, is a general hyperlink. If your\
        link doesn't consist of a single element or pair of elements, as\
        above, then Undum will guess that you have a normal hyperlink. As\
        <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk' class='sticky'>in this link</a>.\
        If you have a link that <em>does</em> look like an Undum link, you\
        can still force Undum not to interpret it as an action or situation\
        move, by adding the CSS class <em>raw</em> to the HTML <em>a</em> tag.\
        links that don't have the <em>raw</em> class, but that are considered\
        to be non-Undum links (like the link above), will have <em>raw</em>\
        added to them before display. This could allow you to style external\
        links differently, as we have done here.</p>\
        \
        <p>In the last situation I said you can prevent links from being\
        turned into regular text when you move situations. This is done\
        by another CSS class: <em>sticky</em>. When you\
        <a href='oneshot'>leave this situation</a>, you'll notice the\
        external link stays active. This can allow you to have options that\
        stay valid throughout the narrative, for example, such as a spell to\
        teleport home.</p>",
